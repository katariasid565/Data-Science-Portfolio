# Marketing Campaign Analysis - EDA & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a **Superstore Marketing Campaign Dataset** to extract meaningful insights and visualize customer behavior. The dataset contains customer demographics, spending habits, and their response to marketing campaigns. By analyzing this data, we aim to optimize future marketing strategies and improve customer segmentation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Perform descriptive statistics and understand data distribution.
- Identify correlations between customer features and spending habits.
- Visualize key insights using advanced plots.
- Segment customers based on spending patterns.

## 📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following key attributes:
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, Education, Marital Status, Income, etc.
- **Purchase Behavior**: Amount spent on different product categories.
- **Marketing Interactions**: Campaign responses, website visits, and promotions.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Number of purchases from different channels.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data handling and processing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps
1. **Loading the Dataset**: Import the dataset and inspect the first few rows.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and fill/drop missing values.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, outliers, and format inconsistencies.
4. **Statistical Summary**: Compute summary statistics for numerical features.
5. **Visual Analysis**:
   - Distribution of customer income and age.
   - Spending behavior across different product categories.
   - Correlation analysis using a heatmap.

## 📊 Key Insights
✔ High-income customers tend to spend more on luxury products.
✔ Different customer segments exhibit varying purchasing behaviors.
✔ Certain customer demographics show a higher response rate to marketing campaigns.
